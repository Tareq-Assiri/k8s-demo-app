============

This repository contains instructions and configuration files for deploying a Kubernetes cluster using MongoDB and a Docker container.

The Original Tutorial
-------------
[Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_o8dwzRlu4&ab_channel=TechWorldwithNana)

Prerequisites
-------------

Before deploying the Kubernetes cluster, you will need to have the following software installed:

- Kubernetes.
- Docker.
- kubectl.

You will also need to have an active Kubernetes cluster to deploy the application to.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started,clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Tareq-Assiri/k8s-demo-app
```
pull the k8s-demo-app image to your local machine using the following command:
```
docker pull nanajanashia/k8s-demo-app:v1.0
```

Deploying to Kubernetes
-----------------------

To deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster, navigate to the `k8s-demo-app` directory and run the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f mongo-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f webapp.yaml
```

This will create a MongoDB deployment with 3 replicas and a webapp deployment with 5 replicas for the k8s-demo-app container.

Accessing the Application
-------------------------

To access the application, you will need to access the NodePort service for the k8s-demo-app container by navigating to `http://<node-ip>:<node-port>` in your web browser.

Cleaning Up
-----------

To delete the MongoDB and k8s-demo-app deployments, run the following command:
```
kubectl delete deployment mongo-deployment webapp-deployment
```

To delete the NodePort service, run the following command:
```
kubectl delete service webapp-service
```

Conclusion
----------
this is just an example on how to deploy a Kubernetes cluster using a docker image
